= mpi interface

Interface specific to mpi version

== write

[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/bop_mpi.h[tag=write]
----
<1> write the header file from `BopData`. Must be called by all ranks
    of the communicator `comm`.
<2> write the data file from `BopData`. Must be called by all ranks
    of the communicator `comm`.

Note that `name` is the basename of the file, without the extension.
This results in the header file `name.bop` and int the data file `name.values`.

The header file will contain the total number of particles, it is reduced internally.

== read

[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/bop_mpi.h[tag=read]
----
<1> read and parse the header file. returns the name of the data file
    in the (user provided) buffer `dfname`.
<2> read data file and store it inside the internal buffer of the
    `BopData` structure. This is a collective operation.

Note: The collective read for ascii values is not supported.
The user must use the serial implementation.
