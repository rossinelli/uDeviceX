= serial interface

Interface specific to sequential version

== write

[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/bop_serial.h[tag=write]
----
<1> write the header file from `BopData`
<2> write the data file from `BopData`

Note that `name` is the basename of the file, without the extension.
This results in the header file `name.bop` and int the data file `name.values`.

== read

[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/bop_serial.h[tag=read]
----
<1> read and parse the header file. returns the name of the data file
    in the (user provided) buffer `dfname`
<2> read data file and store it inside the internal buffer of the
    `BopData` structure
