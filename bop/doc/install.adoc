= Installation

The following will install the binaries into `${HOME}/bin`. This folder needs to be in the `PATH` variable.
Furthermore, it installs the headers and library into
`PREFIX/bop/include` and `PREFIX/bop/lib`, respectively.
`PREFIX` is set to `${HOME}/prefix` by default.

[source,sh]
----
./configure --prefix PREFIX
make
